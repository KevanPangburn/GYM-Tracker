# Gym Tracker
Welcome to the Gym Tracker, a web-based software to track your gym progress.

Please note that this project is currently unfinished and was created with the main objective of learning Git, the process of creating branches, and pull requests.

The software was developed using modern web technologies and aims to provide users with a simple and easy-to-use interface for tracking their gym activities. The features that have been implemented include:

* The basic structure of the website

However, there are still several key features that have not been implemented yet, including:

* User Authentication
* Meal tracking
* Progress reporting
* Mobile compatibility
* Ability to add, edit and delete gym activities
* Visual representation of gym progress

The source code is available on GitHub.

Thank you for your interest in Gym Tracker and I look forward to continuing its development in the future.
